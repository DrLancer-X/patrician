In-progress space adventure for the Gameboy Color. Highly incomplete at this stage.

## License
The code is licensed under the MIT License. Assets (graphics and music) are licensed under CC-BY-SA.

## Compilation instructions
A bash shell (e.g. msys2) and gbdk-2020 (installed in C:\gbdk\) should be sufficient to build the program - simply run `build.sh` from your shell.

Several of the source files are generated by other tools from source assets - they consist of music, sound effects, graphics, tilemaps etc. The tools and source assets for these are located in `tools.zip`, but specific instructions have not been written for these yet. The goal was simply to get the source code published in time for tGB Compo 2021.
